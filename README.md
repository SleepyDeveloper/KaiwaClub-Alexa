Kaiwa Club Skill for Alexa
===
***
This is the official [Little Tokyo Kaiwa Club](https://www.meetup.com/LittleTokyoKaiwaClub/) alexa skill.

At the moment, it's a simple app that looks up the next meetup using [meetup.com's](http://meetup.com) api.

I will be adding new intents and making this app more useful over time.
